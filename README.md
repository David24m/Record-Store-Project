Keith's Record Store

The owner of Keith's Record Store wants an app which will help him keep on top of his store inventory. He does not want an app that customers will see, but he will use to check stock levels and see what he needs to order soon.

You should be able to add stock, which would have an Artist and Album as well as the quantity available.

MVP:

Create albums with the quantity that are in stock
Create artists
Show an inventory page listing albums and artists
Show a stock level for the inventory items e.g. High/Medium/Low
Possible Extensions:

Add a buy and sell price to each stock item
Calculate the possible markup on items and show on inventory page
Add a genre to an Album
Any other ideas you might come up with

This project was completed using Ruby, PostgreSQL and the Sinatra framework and implemented using a RESTful methodology. I was very proud of the final result as it dealt with the MVP of the project, all the requested extensions as well resulting in a good looking app with a high level of functionality.
